OcLaunch is a command-line tool to launch successively (each time the program
is called) commands. It is designed to be used with any program, interactive
or not. Feedback is welcome at leowzukw@vmail.me. Help at
https://gitlab.com/WzukW/oclaunch/wikis/home. Try it, it works automagically!

See the file [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for building and installation
instructions.
