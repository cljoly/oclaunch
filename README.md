<hr/><p>OcLaunch is a command-line tool to launch successively (each time the
program is called) commands. It is designed to be used with any program,
interactive or not. Feedback is welcome at contact@oclaunch.eu.org.<br/>
Detailed presentation at http://ocla.ml. Try it, it works
automagically!</p><p>For example, here is a typical session (you open a
terminal emulator between each item): <ul> <li>You open your first terminal,
your chat client is opened,</li> <li>On second launch of a terminal, your
task list is displayed,</li> <li>On third launch, everything has been done.
You will not see anything more.</li> </ul></p>

See the file [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for building and installation
instructions.
