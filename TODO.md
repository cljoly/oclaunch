## Major issue

## Short term

### Commands
 + Add command to modify configuration file
 + Allow to list all available commands

### Configuration value
 + Make displaying command before launching configurable
 + Allow to run infinitely or say when it is finish
 + Make tmp file emplacement configurable
 + Use two modes, one for easy launch and another more
   complete
    + alway runnig : be sure that there entry are always running
    + easy : one entry on each call
    + confirm : ask before launching each entry
    + proportionate : launch by percent.
 + Relaunch the terminal detached after (possible ?)
 + Allow to tag entry and do things according to tags
 + Display text before and after, maybe in color (For example
   "================================================")

### Misc
 + Documentation ;-)
 + Reuse atdgen for tmp file
 + Handle errors in reading rc file
 + Add build info in binary for 0install

## Long term
 + Translate displayed messages.
 + Better command line interface by grouping commands.
